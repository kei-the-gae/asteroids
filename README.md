This is a [guided project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python) I completed as a part of the Boot.dev back-end developer curriculum. The project is a simple clone of the 2D game of the same name where the player controls a spaceship and must avoid asteroids. It focuses on Object-Oriented Programming and handling multi-file projects.

## Usage

Python 3.10+ is required to run this application.

Clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal from the project root directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

When the game starts, use the following controls:

- `W` to move forward
- `A` to rotate left
- `S` to move backward
- `D` to rotate right
- `SPACE` to shoot
